# Welcome

This website is my first attempt at using the React.js library. I have built a music website to commend Hozier, one of my favourite artists, upon the release of his third album. 

## Initialisation and Installation

1. On your local device clone the repositary: `git clone https://github.com/ollie-byrne99/React_Music_App.git`

2. Install the package dependencies: `npm run dev`.

3. Open the website at local host port: http://localhost:5173/
